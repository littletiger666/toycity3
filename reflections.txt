How long did you spend working on this project?

>> I spent about 8 hours


What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

>> The most rewarding one is argument. The argument name can be very confusing.
Argument in some way, is like method name or variables. You can assign name on them.
The difference is after assigning name: method name and variables are holding values now,
but argument doesn't have value until someone pass a value.

In other words: just pay less attention to argument name.


What two additional features did you build? Why?

>> first feature is like stock monitoring program. I want inventory manager know some urgent
stock information so he/she can make a quicker response.

second feature is total_sales calculator. Total-sales is a very important status. I think my
boss will be happy to see this number raise every day.


Where do you still have room to grow?

>> When I'm doing this project, I met a lot of problems. At the end I understand most of them, but
there are few of them I don't understand.(I can still solve those problems by using some "magic" code
I don't fully understand)
Do I need to fully understand every line of code or I can just use it as long as the result is expected?
